- Development of the simulator

- Testing results:

	1) Effect of the size (and shape) of the environment on the number of redirections, strong changes, collisions, etc.
	2) Effect of the virtual path shapes on the number of redirections, strong changes, collisions, etc.
	3) Effect of the redirected walking algorithms on the number of redirections, strong changes, collisions, etc. 
	4) Effect of the redirected walking algorithms on the short term prediction of user's location.
	5) Number of users / scalability vs. everything 

- Testing finished, results and testing scenarios available in a itHub repository - simulator done

Sprints: 

1) Today's discussion

2) Jan 7:
